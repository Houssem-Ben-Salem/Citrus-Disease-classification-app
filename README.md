# Citrus-Disease-classification-app
A mobile / Web application in react native that can be used by farmers to take a picture of citrus plant and detect if plant has a disease
Dataset

The project uses a publicly available dataset of citrus disease images. The dataset is divided into train and test sets, with a split of 80/20. You can also use your own dataset by modifying the code accordingly.
Model

The model used in this project is a simple CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by a dense layer for classification. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.
Results

The model achieved an accuracy of over 95% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and classifying different types of citrus diseases.
Conclusion

This project serves as a starting point for developing more advanced and sophisticated models for citrus disease detection and classification. The code and model architecture can be easily adapted and improved to meet the needs of different scenarios and applications.
